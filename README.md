This is a coding challenge built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, you'll need to clone the coding challenge repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bkahl1984/code-challenge.git
```

Make sure you're on the master branch:

```bash
git checkout master
```

Second, install the node modules:

```bash
npm install
```

Third, run the development server by running:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

All of my code was done in the following files:

1) page.tsx
2) interfaces.ts
3) helpers.ts
4) app/components/Greetings/Greetings.tsx
5) app/components/Page/Page.tsx
6) app/components/Select/Select.tsx

All of the components and pages were styled using TailwindCSS.

Test Files:

7) app/components/Page/Page.test.tsx
8) app/components/Greeetings/Greetings.test.tsx

To run tests (jest/react-testing-library), go into the root of the project, then do the following:

```bash
npm run test
```
